# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

  ## Text

    - When creating a web page, you add tags to the contents of the page. these tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate stucture for the page. 
      - Markups
        - Structural
          - the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
        - Semantic
          - Provides extra info; such as where emphasis is places in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation, the meaning of acronymes, and so on.
      - Headings
        - <h1> <h2> <h3> and so on to show headings and importance
      - Paragraphs
        - <p> to create a paragraph to start and end </p>
      - Bold & Italic
        - <b> for bold
        - <i> for italic
      - Supercript and Subscript
        - <sup> used to contain characters that should superscript such as suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts
        - <sub> used to contain characters that should be subscript. Commononly used with foot notes or chemical formulas. 

    ## Intro CSS

      - CSS allows you create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.
        - Using external CSS
          - <link> used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to syle the page.
          - <href> specifes the path to the CSS files
          - <type> attribute specifies the type of document being linked to.
          - <rel> specifies the relationship between HTML page and the file it is linked to.
        - Using internal CSS
          - <style> used to indicate that the styles are specifed in CSS

# Operators and Loops

  ## Comparison Operators:
    - ==
        - is equal to
    - !=
        - is NOT equal to
    - === 
        - strict equal to
    - !==
        - Strict NOT equal to
    - >
        - greater than
    - <
        - less than
    - >= 
        - greater than or equal to
    - <= 
        - less than or equal to
  ## structuring comparison operators
    - In any condition, there is usually one operator and 2 operands.
    - Operands are placed on either side of the operator.
    - They can be values or variables
    - You often see expressions enclosed in brackets.
  ## Logic Operators
    - Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more then one comparison operator.
    - &&
        - logical and
        - this operator tests more then one condition
        - ((2<5) && (3>=2))
    -||
        - Logical or
        - this operator tests at least one condition
        - ((2<5>) || (2<1>))
    -!
        - Logical NOT
        - This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.
        - !(2<1>)
  ## Loops
    - Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run.
    - Then the conditon will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again.
    - It repeats until the condition returns false.
    - There are 3 common types:
        - For
            -if u need to run a code a specific number of times
        - While
            - if you dont know how many time you should run the code
        - Do while
            - similar to while, but will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once.
