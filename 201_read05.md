## Color
  - Foreground color
    - the color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
      - RGB values
        - express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.
      - HEX codes
        - These are six-digeit codes that represent the amount of primary colors, preceded by a pound or hash #
      - Color names
        - there are 147 predefined color names that are reconignized by browsers.
  - Background color
    - background-color
      - CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.
      - you can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways, if you do not specify, the background will be transparent.
  - Contrast
    - low contrast, text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and forground colors. a lack of contrast is particularly a problem for those with visual impairments and color blindness.
    - high contrast, text is easier to read, and if you want people to read a lot of text on your page. 
    - medium contrast, for long spans of reading, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.
  - Opacity
    - opacity.rgba
      - which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. 
  - HSL colors
    - Hue
      - the colloquial idea of color, often represents as a color circle where the angle represents the color.

    - Sans-serif
      - fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.
    - Monospace
