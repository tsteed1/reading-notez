# JS Object Literals

## What is an Object?
  - Objects group together a set of variable and functions to create a model of a something that you would recongnize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
  - In an object, variables become known as properties
    - A variable that is part of a object
    - Properties tell us about the object, such as the name or number.
  - In an object, functions become known as Methods.
    - If a function is part of an object, it is called a Method.
    - Methods represent tasks that associated with the object.
       <!-- Properties (these are variables) -->
        name: 'Quay',
        rooms: 40,
        booked: 25,
        gym: true,
        roomTypes: ['twin', 'double', 'suite'],
        <!-- Method (this is a function) -->
        checkAvailability: function() {
          return this.rooms - this.booked;
        }
    - Properties:   Key           Value
                    name          string
                    rooms         number
                    booked        number
                    gym           boolean
                    roomTypes     array

    - Methods: checkAvailability  function

  - Programmers use a lot of name/value pairs:
    - HTML uses attributes names and values.
    - CSS uses property names and values.
  - In JS
    - Variables have a name and you can assign them a value of a sting, number, or boolean.
    - Arrays have a nmae and a group of values.
    - Names functions have a name and value that is a set of statements to run if the function is called.
    - Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs.

## Document Object model
  - This specifies how browseres should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
  - DOM is neither part of HTML or JS. It has its own set of rules.
  - It is implemented by all majore browser makers, and covers 2 primary areas:
    - Make a model of the HTML page. 
      - When a browswer loads a web page, it creates a model of the page in memory.
      - DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using a DOM Tree.
    - Accessing and Changing the HTML page.
      - DOM also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in this model, in which turns updates what the user sees in the browers.
      -Application Programming Interface (API)
        - User interfaces let humans interact with programs, APS's let programs talk to each other. 
  - Accessing Elements
    - DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes.
    - Methods that return a single element node
      <!-- - getElementById('id') -->
        - selects and individuel element given the value of its id attribute. The HTML must have an id attribute in order for it to be selectable.
      <!-- - quertSelector('css selector') -->
        - Uses CSS selector syntax that would select one or more elements. This method returns only the first of the matching elements.
    - Methods that return one or more elements (as a Nodelist)
      <!-- - getElementsByClasName('class') -->
        - Selects one or more elements given the value of their class attribute. The HTML must have a class attribute for it to be selectable.
      <!-- - getElementsByTagName('tageName') -->
        - Selects elements on th epage with the specifies tag name. This method is faster than querySelectorAll()
      <!-- -querySelectorAll(css selector') -->
        - Uses CSS selector syntax to select one or more elements and returns all of those that match.
