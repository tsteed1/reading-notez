# HTML Tables; JS Contructor Functions

## Domain Modeling
  - the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
  - A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. 
  - An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
  - A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.
  - Define a constructor and initialize properties
    - var EpicFailVideo = function(epicRating, hasAnimals) {
        this.epicRating = epicRating;
        this.hasAnimals = hasAnimals;
      }
      var parkourFail = new EpicFailVideo(7, false);
      var corgiFail = new EpicFailVideo(4, true);

      console.log(parkourFail);
      console.log(corgiFail);
    - in this, the constructor function is being used a function expression. The variable is being declared "EpicFailVideo" and then assigned a function with 2 parameters, epicRating and has Animals.
    - after ther contstructor function, 2 objects are instantiated with the "new" keyword and their properties are initiallezed by the calling the "parkourFail' and "corgiFail".
    - to model, you'll need a random number generator:
      var EpicFailVideo = function(epicRating, hasAnimals) {
        this.epicRating = epicRating;
        this.hasAnimals = hasAnimals;
      }

      EpicFailVideo.prototype.generateRandom = function(min, max) {
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
      }

      var parkourFail = new EpicFailVideo(7, false);
      var corgiFail = new EpicFailVideo(4, true);

      console.log(parkourFail.generateRandom(1, 5));
      console.log(corgiFail.generateRandom(1, 5));

  - Creating an object: Constructor Notation
    - The "new" keyword and the object constructor create a blank object that you can then add properties and methods to.
    - to update a object, simply use a dot notation or square braket.
    - to delete a property, us the "delete" keyword.
      - hotel.name = 'park';
        <!-- hotel is the object -->
        <!-- . is the member operator -->
        <!-- name is the Property Name -->
        <!-- = is the assignment operator -->
        <!-- 'park' is the property value -->
  - they keyword 'this' is used inside functions and objects where the function is declared, alters what 'this' means. It refers to one object that the function operates.
  - Arrays are objects too!
    - arrays are actuallu a special type of object that hold a related set of key pairs but the key for each value is its index number

  ## what is a table?
    - a table represents the information on a grid.
    - basic stucture of a table:
      - <table> is used to create the table
      - <tr> is used to indicate the start of each row.
      - <td> is used to represent each sell on a table.
      - <th> is used just like <td> element but it represents the heading for either a column or a row
      - <thead> the headings for a table
      - <thbody> the body
      - <tfoot> the footer
