## Layouts
  - Building blocks
    - CSS treats each HTML elemtnet as if it is in its own box. This bos will either be a block-level box or an inline-box.
  - Containing elements
    - If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
  - Normal flow
    - postion: static;
    - each block-level element sits on top of the next one.
  - Relative Positioning 
    - postion: relative;
    - moves and element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
  - Absolute Positioning
    - position: absolute;
    - the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.
