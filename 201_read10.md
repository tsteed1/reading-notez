# Debugging

## Order of Execution
  - It helps to know how scripts are processed of how to find the source of an error. 
    - order
      - 1. the greeting variable gets its value from the greetUser() function
      - 2. greetUser() creates the message by combining the string 'Hello' wotj tje result of getName().
      - 3. getName() returns the name to greetUser().
      - 2. greetUser() now knows the name, and combines it with the string. It then returns the message to the statment that called it in step1.
      - 1. the value of the greeting is stored in memory.
      - 4. This greeting variable is written to an alert box.
  - Execution Contexts
    - The JS interpreter uses the concept of execution contexts.
      - Contexts
        - Global
          - Code that is in the script, but not in the function. 
        - Function
          - Code that is being run within a function
        - Eval
          - Text is executed like code in an internal function
        - 
      - Variable Scope
        - Global Scope
          - If a variable is declared outside a function, it can be used anywhere because it has a global scope
        - function-level scope
          - When a variable is declared within a function, it can only be used within that function.
  - Execution Content & Hoisting
    - Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are 2 phases of activity.
      - 1: Prepare
        - the new scope is created
        - Variables, functions, and arguments are created
        - The value of the this keyword is determined
      - 2: Execute
        - Now it can assign values to variables
        - Reference functions and run their code.
        - Execute statements
