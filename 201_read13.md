# Local Storage

## Diving In
  - Cookies were invented early in the webâ€™s history, and they can be used for local storage of small amounts of data, but they have three downsides:
    - Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by  transmitting data over and over
    - Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet
    - Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data
  - what we really want:
    - storage space
    - on the client
    - stays on the page
    - not being transmitted to the server
  - Before HTML5, all other attempts were failures.
## what is HTML5 storage?
  - a specific named web storage 
  - its a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs, within clients web browsers. The named data is also a string.
    - this data can be used for any type of supported by JS, including strings, Booleans, integers or floats but the data is stored in a string. 
      - since we are storing these in strings, we have to sue functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to move your data into the expected JS datatype
    - Local Storage or DOM storage
    - to check for HTML5 Storage 
      - if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
          // window.localStorage is available!
        else {
          // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
          // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
        }
  -  You can treat the local Storage object as an array. Instead of using the getItem() and setItem() methods:
    - var foo = localStorage.getItem("bar");
      // ...
      localStorage.setItem("bar", foo);
  - you can simply use [].
    - var foo = localStorage["bar"];
      // ...
      localStorage["bar"] = foo;
  - you can also clear the entire storage area or remove the value for a given key
    - interface Storage {
      deleter void removeItem(in DOMString key);
      void clear();
      };
  - lastly there is also a property to get you a total number of value in the storage area
    - interface Storage {
      readonly attribute unsigned long length;
      getter DOMString key(in unsigned long index);
      };
