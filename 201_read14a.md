# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## Transforms
  - The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.
    - Two-dimensional 
        - Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes.
      - 2d Rotation
        - provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.
          - .box-1 {
              transform: rotate(20deg);
            }
            .box-2 {
              transform: rotate(-55deg);
            }
      - 2d Scale
        - allows you to change the appeared size of an element.
          - .box-1 {
              transform: scale(.75);
            }
            .box-2 {
              transform: scale(1.25);
            }
        - It is possible to scale only the height or width of an element using the scaleX and
          scaleY values
      - 2d Translate
        - translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis
        - translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.
      - 2d Skew
        - used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both.
          - Using the skewX value distorts an element on the horizontal axis
          - skewY value distorts an element on the vertical axis. 
      - Perspective
        - a perspective is needed order for three-dimensional transforms to work the elements.
        - the perspective of element can be set in to 2 differnt ways:
          - The perspective of an element can be set in two different ways. One way includes
              using the perspective value within the transform property on individual elements
          - the other includes using the perspective property on the parent element residing over
              child elements being transformed.
    - 3d transforms
      - we can change elements on the z axis, giving us control of depth as well as length and width.
      - 3d rotate
        - can rotate an element around any axes.
        - rotateX value allows you to rotate an element around the x axis, as if it were being bent in half horizontally.
        - rotateY value allows you to rotate an element around the y axis, as if it were being bent in half vertically.
      - 3d scale
        - elements may be scaled on the z axis
      - 3d translate
        - translated on the z axis using the translateZ value
## Transitions
  - for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state
    - :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
      - .box {
          background: #2db34a;
          transition-property: background;
          transition-duration: 1s;
          transition-timing-function: linear;
        }
        .box:hover {
          background: #ff7b29;
        }
## Animations
  - when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. 
    - Keyframes
      - to set mult. points at which an element should undergo a transition
        - includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended 
            to be animated.
    - Animation Name
      - applied to the element in which the animation is to be applied to
    - Animation Duration, Timing Function, & Delay
      - Once you have declared the animation-name property on an element, animations behave similarly to transitions. 
        - include a duration, timing function, and delay if desired.
