# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

25 year old Julia Rozovky who was working at a consulting firm and decided it wasnt a good fit for her, so she become a researcher for 2 professors at harvard but just wasnt it either. She thought maybe a big corporation would be a good fit or a fast growing start-up would fit her. all she knew is that she wanted to be closer to the community, part of something people would eventually build together. In 2009, she made her decision and applied to business school and was accepted by Yale School of Management. Struggling finding the right fit partners for projects was a stressful environment, everyone was so smart just like herself but she just didnt fit in the group. eventually she found a good group and ended up with project, microgy, and ended up wining the competition. She ended up being stuck with the group for 2 years at Yale.

  - Take-Aways from this.
    - ‘‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.’’ 
    - ‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’
    - Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized.
    - no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations.
