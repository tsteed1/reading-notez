# Day-2 Notes

## What is a Text Editor?
  -A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
  - Some features you should look for in a Test editor are:
    - code completion
    - syntax highlighting
    - nice variety of themes 
    - and the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
        extensions available when you need them.
        
## Whats the difference between a Text Editor and IDEs you may ask?
  - A Text editor, does what it says, it edits text, but also manages text and files where as a IDE(Integrated Development Environment) is a Text Editor too 
    but this also does filer manager, a compiler, and a dubugger all in one.
  - Just think of a simple Notepad document cared to a Microsoft Outlook doc. you can much more in outlook compared to notepad, such as and email client, 
    a calendar, task manager, and so on.

## What exactly is Linux?
  - Linux is an extensionless system
    -This one can sometimes be hard to get your head around but as you work through the sections it will start to make more sense. 
      A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. 
      The following are common extensions:
      - file.exe - an executable file, or program.
      - file.txt - a plain text file.
      -file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
