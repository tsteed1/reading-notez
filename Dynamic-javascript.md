## What is JavaScript? ##
    - JaveScript is written in plain text like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.
    - When you want to use Java with a web page, you can use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. its src attribute tells people where the Java file is stored.

## Summary ##
    - It is best to kepp Javascript code in its own file. Javascript files are text files, but they have the .js extension.
    - The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file.
    -If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the Javascript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works witht he model of the web page that browser has created.
