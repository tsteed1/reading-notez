## What is a growth mindset?
### With a growth mindset, the world is at your mercy. You can do anything your mind is set to and beable to further yourself and encourage other people that they can do whatever they want to do. ###
  * Keep your head up and persevere, even when you fail over and over. As Thomas Edison once said,*"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."*
  * Embrace and overcome your fears of trying new things
  * Continue to be inspired to do better!
### My name is Travis Steed. I enjoy all outdoor activites, playing games with friends, and be able to create and craft different beers. [travis's website](https://github.com/tsteed1/reading-notez/edit/master/README.md) :+1:
