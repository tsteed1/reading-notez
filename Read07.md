# Programming with JavaScript

## Examples of JavaScript in the Browser. 
    - Access, the content of the page.
    - Modify, the content of the page.
    - Program, rules or instructions the browser can follow.
    - React, to events triggered by the user or browser.
## Script
    - A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following:
        - Recipes
        - Handbooks
        - manuals
    - Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step.
    - A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
    - Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.
    - To approach writing a script, break down your goals into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task.
## Expressions
    - An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. broadly speaking there are 2 types:
        - Expressions that just assign a value ito a variable.
            -var color = 'beige';
            - the value of color is now beige.
        - Expressions that use 2 or more values to return a single value.
            - var area = 3*2;
            - the value of area is now 6.
## Operators
    - Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
        - Arithimatic operators, that can use numbers.
            - var subtotal = (13+1)*5; //subtotal is 70
            - var shipping = 0.5 * (13+1); // Shipping is 7.
        - String operators, there is just one string operator: the + symbol. it is used to join strings on either side.
            - var firstName = 'Ivy';
            - var lastName = 'stone';
            - var fullName = firstName + lastName;
