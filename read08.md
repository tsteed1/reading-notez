# Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators:
    - ==
        - is equal to
    - !=
        - is NOT equal to
    - === 
        - strict equal to
    - !==
        - Strict NOT equal to
    - >
        - greater than
    - <
        - less than
    - >= 
        - greater than or equal to
    - <= 
        - less than or equal to
## structuring comparison operators
    - In any condition, there is usually one operator and 2 operands.
    - Operands are placed on either side of the operator.
    - They can be values or variables
    - You often see expressions enclosed in brackets.
## Logic Operators
    - Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more then one comparison operator.
    - &&
        - logical and
        - this operator tests more then one condition
        - ((2<5) && (3>=2))
    -||
        - Logical or
        - this operator tests at least one condition
        - ((2<5>) || (2<1>))
    -!
        - Logical NOT
        - This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.
        - !(2<1>)
## Loops
    - Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run.
    - Then the conditon will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again.
    - It repeats until the condition returns false.
    - There are 3 common types:
        - For
            -if u need to run a code a specific number of times
        - While
            - if you dont know how many time you should run the code
        - Do while
            - similar to while, but will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once.
